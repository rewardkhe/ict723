                <h3>Stocks</h3>
                <p>Stocks are shares of ownership in a corporation. The stock market is a place where stocks are bought and sold. The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) is the corporation that governs our local stock market. People buy or invest in stocks to benefit from a company's tremendous value potential over time. Once you buy or invest into a stock you now become part owner or a shareholder of that particular corporation. In return for your investment, you gain part ownership of the company and become a shareholder. As a shareholder you are entitled to dividends and appreciation of your stock.</p>
